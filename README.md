# 🔬 Arduino Labs Collection

Welcome to my personal Arduino lab series — a hands-on journey through electronics, sensors, and embedded systems using Arduino UNO.

Each folder contains a focused project with:
- 🧠 Source code (`.ino`)
- 🔌 Circuit diagram (`.png`)
- 📄 Per-project README

> ✍️ **Goal:** Learn by doing — one concept, one project at a time.
