# üéµ Tone Sequencer with Button & LEDs

This Arduino project plays a sequence of musical notes (C4‚ÄìB4) with synchronized LED lights when a button is pressed. It also demonstrates passive buzzer control and LED sequencing.

## üß† How It Works

- When the button is pressed:
  - A tone is played on the buzzer from C4 to B4.
  - A corresponding LED lights up for each tone.
- Each note lasts **1 second**, followed by a **brief pause**.
- Button press is stabilized with **debounce logic**.

## üí° Highlights

- ‚úÖ Use of `tone()` and `noTone()`
- ‚úÖ LED sequencing with arrays
- ‚úÖ Debouncing button inputs
- ‚úÖ Clean code with `constexpr` and loops

---

## üß™ Planned Improvements

- Add more tones or chords.
- Create a long-press to play in reverse.
- Add a second mode with a toggle switch.
